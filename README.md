# cs2-calculator
Project for CS2 class

Some functions are not enabled as of first commit, these functions may or may not be enabled at a later time.

Additionally, this project was built primarily using the SwingBuilder tool.

This calculator was intended to mimic the look and feel of the Windows 10 Programmer Calculator as closely as possible.

A runnable .jar version is included if you'd like to run it yourself and compare.
